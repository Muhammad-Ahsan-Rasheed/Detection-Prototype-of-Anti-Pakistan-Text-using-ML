# Detection-Prototype-of-Anti-Pakistan-Text-using-ML
# Data Collection
The model is trained using data scrapped from twitter using twint library
The data is labeled 0 and 1 , 1 represents Anti State tweet and 0 represents Not Anti State tweets.

------------


# ML Algorithm
A few ML algorithms are used and the one with highes accuracy (RandomForestClassifier) is saved and deployed using Flask.

------------


Open the jupyter notebook and checkout the code. The code is beautifully commented , it should not be difficult for u
to understand it.

------------


# Data Cleaning
The functions used to clean the data,and preprocess are attached attached.

------------


# Libraries Used
The required libraries are:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- nltk
- flask
- jinja


`P.S: if compiler asks you to download any library then download it.`

> the flask app should be given cleand data to work ( e.g "testingdata" in model training folder)

use "testingdata.csv" to test the flask app.
